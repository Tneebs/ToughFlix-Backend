# ToughFlix Backend

This README covers the backend of ToughFlix, a movie application that targets the chore of choosing a movie to watch between two people. 

To tackle the problem of two users being able to connect with one another, I used a self referential relationship.

# Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of Rails
```
    $ gem install rails
```

# Starting the Server

Ensure that you are running the Backend server first, before running the Frontend server.

- change directories
```
    $ cd backend
```

- start the server
```
    $ rails s
```
